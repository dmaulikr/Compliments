Complements is a casual, procedurally generated puzzle game for iOS. Players swipe the screen to send cascades of colored dots
across the board, where they’ll interact with the dots that are already there. When two primary-colored dots collide, they’ll 
mix to create a secondary-colored dot (a red dot and blue dot will leave a purple dot). When two secondary-colored dots collide,
they’ll leave a dot of the primary color that the two secondary colors share (a purple dot and a green dot will leave a blue dot).
When two complementary colored dots collide, a chime will play, the dots will mix into a white dot, and the player gets points.

The game was designed as a final project for an iOS development class at New York University.
